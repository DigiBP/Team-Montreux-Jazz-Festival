Telemedicine pathway

Introduction 

Nowadays, a continuous increase in healthcare burden across several countries is being seen which might present a serious difficulty towards the sustained provision and enhancement of patients health. By these means, the first major load comes when someone wants to confirm an appointment with their doctor, and continuos waiting times and delays are also observed, which might end up causing patient disconfort (the payers). Several times the presenciality in the clinical consult room is not required which might indicate the help that telemedicine technologies could serve to the general public. Telemedicine is the practice of medicine using technology to deliver care at a distance using telecommunications infrastructure between a patient at one side and a physician or other licensed practioner at other site. However, making the doctor to decide which consults to take presently and which remotely might be time-consuming and subject to inter-phisician  differneces. 

Project goal 

To design a fully-automated workflow where the patient fills a survey and the presence/remote decision is made and the present/digital room are reserved and sent via mail to the patient which then has the capability to choose the available consult day and hour. Moreover, the appointment is saved in doctor's and patient's agenda.
